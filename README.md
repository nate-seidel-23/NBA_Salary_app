# NBA Salary Tool

ðŸ”— [Live App](https://nba-salary-app.vercel.app/)

This web app allows you to explore the salary sheets for all 30 NBA franchises across the next 6 seasons. Dive into year-to-year changes, track cap space, and see how each team stacks up against evolving salary cap thresholds.

## Features

* View team salary sheets from 2024 through 2029
* Toggle between different years to compare changes over time
* See cap thresholds like the luxury tax and apron levels per season

## Data Sources

* **Salaries & Player Headshots**: [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)
* **Team Logos**: Accessed via [ESPN.com](https://www.espn.com/) â€” all logos belong to the NBA

## Future Plans for App
* I plan to continue building on this App, beginning with more reliable data, with specifics on free agents and two-way players.
* More plans involve a trade analyzer, free agency overview, and making the salary sheet more interactive to make the rosters easy to edit.

## Technology Used
* React, Node.js
